							<p>My research focuses on applying econometrics, machine learning/AI, and simulation to solve real-world data-driven 
							business problems in the context of supply chain operations management (SCOM). The central theme of my dissertation 
								is the vulnerability of global supply chain networks.

							<p>
								Additionally, at MIT, I am actively involved in two main 
								areas of research. Firstly, I am studying human-AI collaboration in demand planning through a field experiment 
								conducted in collaboration with a major multinational fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company and its customer. 
								Using Mediation Analyses, I am investigating the conditions under which human-AI collaboration is beneficial and 
								when the algorithm version appears. Secondly, I am empirically analyzing the impact of supply chain 
								digitalization on firm productivity.
							</p>
							<p>
								In conducting these studies, I utilize machine learning techniques, including text analytics, web scraping,

								Using a large sample of approximately 210,000 supplier-firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize 
									the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms' upstream industries. The developed measures show an 
									upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be 
									concentrated in a few nations or small geographical areas (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the 
									downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, 
									we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in highly concentrated industries, on average, 
									experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample 
									suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers' industries are 
									concentrated mainly in a few nations or small geographical areas. We find evidence that the link between upstream 
									suppliers' industry-level concentrations and downstream firms' sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms 
									can moderate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker 
									for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are 
									robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. The results of this study may 
									serve to help policymakers and managers systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential 
									to create bottlenecks. These bottlenecks may cause severe shortages or even threaten national security. Additionally, 
									the measures give insights to policymakers into which industries to support for onshoring.

								This study examines how firms adjust their sourcing decisions due to variations in policy uncertainty and if such 
									adjustments result in performance effects. Specifically, we assess how policy uncertainty influences a 
									focal firm’s decisions to restructure its supply chain along two dimensions: (a) onshoring/offshoring and 
									(b) geopolitical diversification/concentration. The empirical evidence suggests that managers decrease the 
									the ratio of onshore suppliers and diversify their supply base geopolitically in response to heightened upstream 
									policy uncertainty affecting the suppliers. However, we do not find evidence of the influence of domestic 
									policy uncertainty on the focal firm’s decision to adjust the structure of its supply base. To provide 
									actionable advice for mitigating adverse effects resulting from policy uncertainty, we also conduct a 
									posthoc analysis linking supply chain structure to focal firms’ performance. Our results indicate that, 
									consistent with transaction cost economics, firms with more suppliers onshore and a geopolitically 
									concentrated supply base demonstrates superior performance when their suppliers are exposed to heightened 
									policy uncertainty. As such, our investigation reveals that the managerial response of increasing offshoring 
									and diversifying supply bases may be counterproductive. The estimates are robust and identified through several empirical methodologies.</i>.

								Supply networks are vulnerable to disruptions not only because of their immediate damages but also because
								of their cascading effects. We posit that the structure of supply networks plays a significant role in cascading
								disruption and that the ability to find nexus suppliers can help to lessen the impact of cascading disruptions.
								Therefore, we examine the effect of three network structural characteristics: modularity, assortativity, and
								structural holes. We find that the lack of ties among the supplier’s neighbors (structural holes), increases the
								impact of a cascade emanating from that supplier. In addition, modularity and assortativity have heterogeneous
								effects on cascading disruptions across the conditional distributions of the outcome variables of performance.
								Modularity and assortativity generally have deteriorating effects on network resilience; however, they have
								beneficial effects during extreme events. In addition, we develop a new predictive model to identify the nexus
								suppliers whose disruptions would significantly impact focal firms’ operations. The model gives managers a
								tool to effectively identify nexus suppliers located deep in a supply network.</i>.

								<a>
								We use a large-scale panel dataset to investigate the relationship between suppliers' exposure to political instability and firms' 
									performance. The empirical evidence suggests a U-shaped relationship between the political instability of suppliers' countries 
									and buyer firms' performance, indicating that firms experience the highest benefits when suppliers are located at the extreme 
									ends of the political instability spectrum. Sourcing from the least politically unstable countries can reduce transaction costs 
									(costs incurred in conducting economic transactions) to improve firm performance by limiting information search and contract 
									negotiations, which align with the purchase cost minimization explanations of the transaction cost economics (TCE) framework. 
									On the other hand, sourcing from highly politically unstable countries allows firms to leverage institutional arbitrage and 
									bargaining power to decrease procurement prices, aligning with TCE explanations related to agreement enforcement and compliance 
									expenses. Furthermore, we discovered that the relationship varies depending on the industry category of the firms. The U-shaped 
									relationship is more pronounced for firms in industries with higher productivity, while it is inverted for firms in durable goods 
									industries. Interestingly, our post hoc analyses did not reveal any U-shaped effect between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) 
									of suppliers' countries and buyer firms' performance. In fact, our sample reveals a negative linear relationship between the 
									EPU of suppliers' countries and buyer firms' performance, highlighting the distinction between EPU and political instability. 
									Our estimates are robust, consistently identified through several empirical methodologies, and align with theoretical predictions.</i>.

								Supply chains are prone to several operational and disruption risks. In order to design a resilient supply chain network
									capable of responding to such potential risks suitably, this paper proposes a novel framework for the business 
									continuity-inspired resilient supply chain network design (BCRSCND) problem, which includes three steps. First, 
									four resilience dimensions including Anticipation, Preparation, Robustness, and Recovery are considered to quantify
									the resilience score of each facility using a multi-criteria decision-making technique and considering a comprehensive
									set of resilience strategies. In the second step, the critical processes and their business continuity metrics 
									(which are vital for supply chain continuity), are identified. The outputs of the first two steps provide the inputs 
									of a novel two-stage mixed possibilistic-stochastic programing (TSMPSP) model. The model aims to design a multi-echelon,
									multi-product resilient supply chain network under both operational and disruption risks. The proposed TSMPSP model allows
									decision makers to incorporate their risk attitudes into the design process. After converting the original TSMPSP model 
									into the crisp counterpart, several sensitivity analyses are conducted on different features of hypothetical disruptions
									(i.e. their severity, likelihood and location) and DM’s risk attitudes from which useful managerial insights are provided.

									This paper investigates the use of sourcing strategies to achieve supply chain resilience under disruptions. 
									The coping strategies considered are single and multiple sourcing, backup supplier contracts, spot purchasing,
									and collaboration and visibility. Collaboration and visibility, which affect suppliers’ recovery capabilities 
									and a buyer’s warning capability, have not been similarly modelled in the past. A scenario-based mathematical 
									model is developed such that it considers objectives under uncertainties including disruption risks and operational
									risks. A broad numerical study examines its output for various risk attitudes in a decision-maker, ranging from risk 
									neutral to risk averse. The sensitivity of procurement strategies to other key parameters such as recovery and warning 
									capabilities is examined. One of the major findings is that buyer’s warning capability plays a vital role in enhancing
									supply chain resilience. We seek to build on these efforts to further support disruption planning and mitigation and 
									to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between supply chain characteristics and resilience.

								Most of current logistics network design models in the literature typically assume that facilities are always available 
									and absolutely reliable while in practice, they are always subject to several operational and disruption risks. 
									This paper proposes a reliable closed-loop supply chain network design model, which accounts for both partial 
									and complete facility disruptions as well as the uncertainty in the critical input data. The proposed model is 
									of mixed integer possibilistic linear programming type that aims to minimise simultaneously the total cost of 
									opening new facilities and the expected cost of disruption scenarios. An enhanced possibilistic programming 
									approach is proposed to deal with the epistemic uncertainty in input data. Furthermore, the p-robustness criterion
									is used to limit the cost of disruption scenarios and protect the designed network against random facility disruptions. 
									Several numerical experiments along with sensitivity analyses on uncertain parameters are conducted to illustrate
									the significance and applicability of the developed model as well as the effectiveness of the proposed solution 
									approach. Our results demonstrate that operational and disruption risks considerably affect the whole structure 
									of the designed network and they must be taken into account when designing a reliable closed-loop logistics network.

									This paper designs a reliability distribution network with limited capacity under partial and complete 
									facility disruptions. To increase the reliability of the distribution network, a new mixed integer linear 
									programing model is developed by considering multiple mitigation strategies including diversification, 
									fortification, and transshipment. The distribution network constitutes of reliable distribution centers 
									are more expensive, always available and not affected by disruption, and unreliable distribution centers. 
									Thus, they might be fortified at any level of reliability. Several numerical examples with sensitivity 
									analyses are conducted to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model. Results demonstrate that the 
									transshipment strategy is more effective than the other mitigation strategies on distribution network 
									reliability and cost.

								Supply chain literature has amply explored the effect of different resilience strategies in the face of supply chain disruptions. 
									Firms often apply a multitude of resilience strategies in tandem. Such strategies can vary from slack inventory to volume 
									flexibility and responsiveness to backup capacity. Yet, there is a lack of empirical or analytical evidence in how the 
									combination of resilience strategies affects firm capabilities in the face of supply chain disruptions. In this paper, 
									we use simulation modeling techniques to determine the effect of different combinations of resilience strategies in a 
									systematic and stepwise manner. Our modeling considers different disruption attributes (capacity or delay), their effect 
									(severity and likelihood), and their origin (i.e. upstream or downstream). A number of interesting observations are made. 
									First, combining resilience strategies is not always beneficial and can occasionally have detrimental effects. Moreover, 
									resilience strategies that are beneficial at the node (firm) level may prove ineffective at the system level. We also 
									find that inventory and volume flexibility are strategies that combine well with others. The study offers several 
									contributions to research and management in supply chain disruption and the study of resilience.

									How  do  supply  chain  managers  know  which  risk  mitigation  or  resilience  strategies are  best  in  a  given  disruption  scenario?  
										In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate  how  different  disruption attributes  impact  supply  chain  performance  through  both  direct 
										and  indirect  interaction.  Next,  we develop  an  empirically  grounded  simulation  to  determine  the  specific  resilience 
										strategies  that  are most  effective  against  disruptions  in  various  categories  for  improving  supply  chain  performance after  
										a  disruption.  These  results  are  then  used  to  develop  a  guide  for  supply  chain  risk  management strategy  selection.  
										We  expand  on  prior  work  by    defining  disruptions  based  on  varying  levels  and categories  of  five  attributes  (disruption  
										type,  location,  severity,  likelihood,  and  length).  This  allows us  to  explain  and  resolve  the  equivocal  implications  
										regarding  the  relationship  between  disruption attributes  and  supply  chain  performance  and  the  interaction  of  these 
										attributes.  Our  findings  can help  managers  develop  an  effective  resilience  strategy  based  on  the  attributes  of  a 
										specific disruption based  on type, location, severity, likelihood and length.
