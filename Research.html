								Supply chains are prone to several operational and disruption risks. In order to design a resilient supply chain network
									capable of responding to such potential risks suitably, this paper proposes a novel framework for the business 
									continuity-inspired resilient supply chain network design (BCRSCND) problem, which includes three steps. First, 
									four resilience dimensions including Anticipation, Preparation, Robustness, and Recovery are considered to quantify
									the resilience score of each facility using a multi-criteria decision-making technique and considering a comprehensive
									set of resilience strategies. In the second step, the critical processes and their business continuity metrics 
									(which are vital for supply chain continuity), are identified. The outputs of the first two steps provide the inputs 
									of a novel two-stage mixed possibilistic-stochastic programing (TSMPSP) model. The model aims to design a multi-echelon,
									multi-product resilient supply chain network under both operational and disruption risks. The proposed TSMPSP model allows
									decision makers to incorporate their risk attitudes into the design process. After converting the original TSMPSP model 
									into the crisp counterpart, several sensitivity analyses are conducted on different features of hypothetical disruptions
									(i.e. their severity, likelihood and location) and DM’s risk attitudes from which useful managerial insights are provided.

									This paper investigates the use of sourcing strategies to achieve supply chain resilience under disruptions. 
									The coping strategies considered are single and multiple sourcing, backup supplier contracts, spot purchasing,
									and collaboration and visibility. Collaboration and visibility, which affect suppliers’ recovery capabilities 
									and a buyer’s warning capability, have not been similarly modelled in the past. A scenario-based mathematical 
									model is developed such that it considers objectives under uncertainties including disruption risks and operational
									risks. A broad numerical study examines its output for various risk attitudes in a decision-maker, ranging from risk 
									neutral to risk averse. The sensitivity of procurement strategies to other key parameters such as recovery and warning 
									capabilities is examined. One of the major findings is that buyer’s warning capability plays a vital role in enhancing
									supply chain resilience. We seek to build on these efforts to further support disruption planning and mitigation and 
									to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between supply chain characteristics and resilience.

								Most of current logistics network design models in the literature typically assume that facilities are always available 
									and absolutely reliable while in practice, they are always subject to several operational and disruption risks. 
									This paper proposes a reliable closed-loop supply chain network design model, which accounts for both partial 
									and complete facility disruptions as well as the uncertainty in the critical input data. The proposed model is 
									of mixed integer possibilistic linear programming type that aims to minimise simultaneously the total cost of 
									opening new facilities and the expected cost of disruption scenarios. An enhanced possibilistic programming 
									approach is proposed to deal with the epistemic uncertainty in input data. Furthermore, the p-robustness criterion
									is used to limit the cost of disruption scenarios and protect the designed network against random facility disruptions. 
									Several numerical experiments along with sensitivity analyses on uncertain parameters are conducted to illustrate
									the significance and applicability of the developed model as well as the effectiveness of the proposed solution 
									approach. Our results demonstrate that operational and disruption risks considerably affect the whole structure 
									of the designed network and they must be taken into account when designing a reliable closed-loop logistics network.

									This paper designs a reliability distribution network with limited capacity under partial and complete 
									facility disruptions. To increase the reliability of the distribution network, a new mixed integer linear 
									programing model is developed by considering multiple mitigation strategies including diversification, 
									fortification, and transshipment. The distribution network constitutes of reliable distribution centers 
									are more expensive, always available and not affected by disruption, and unreliable distribution centers. 
									Thus, they might be fortified at any level of reliability. Several numerical examples with sensitivity 
									analyses are conducted to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model. Results demonstrate that the 
									transshipment strategy is more effective than the other mitigation strategies on distribution network 
									reliability and cost.

								The concentration of industries can provide benefits of efficiency and scale. However, the dark side can lead to exposing the downstream firms 
									to vulnerabilities during disruptions. In addition to the well-known notion of concentration due to the dominance of a few firms within 
									an industry (i.e., industrial concentration), our study highlights the role of a relatively under-recognized dimension of geopolitical 
									concentration. Using a large data set of firms, supply chain configurations, and key firm performance metrics, we find that high industrial 
									and geopolitical concentration in a firm’s upstream industries has a significant negative effect on the firm’s resilience during an external 
									disruption. Our findings are based on the globally disruptive shock faced by firms in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, 
									the sales growth of firms whose suppliers are operating in high concentrated industries saw a relative drop of almost 5 percentage points 
									during the pandemic period. The negative effect is statistically and economically significant and is consistently identified through three 
									different empirical strategies. Our robust findings provide insights for both policy makers and managers for monitoring and mitigating the 
									risks that industrial and geopolitical concentration impose on downstream firms’ resilience.

								<a>Supply  networks  are  vulnerable  to  disruptions  not  only  because  of  their  immediate  damages  but  also because  of  their  cascading  
									effects.  The  structure  of  supply  networks  affects  and  may  inadvertently accelerate  the  propagation  of  disruptions.  Yet,  from  
									a  systematic  view,  little  is  known  about  the  link between  the  structural  characteristics  of  supply  networks  and  the  disruption  
									cascades.  In  the  first  part of  this  study,  we  examine  the  effect  of  three  network  structural  characteristics:  modularity, 
									assortativity,  and  structural  holes.  We  find  that  a  lack  of  structural  holes  in  a  supplier’s  ego  network decreases  the  
									impact  of  a  cascade  emanating  from  that  supplier.  Moreover,  quantile  regression  reveals that  modularity  and  assortativity  
									have  heterogenous  effects  on  cascading  disruptions  across  the conditional  distributions  of  the  outcome  variables  of  interest.  
									Modularity  and  assortativity  generally have  deteriorating  effects  on  network  resilience;  however,  they  have  beneficial  effects  
									during  extreme events.  In  the  second  part  of  this  study,  we  develop  a  new  predictive  model  to  identify  the  nexus suppliers 
									whose disruptions would have  a large impact on focal  firms’ operations.
